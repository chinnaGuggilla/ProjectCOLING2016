We are very happy to announce WIT: Wikipedia-Based Image Text Dataset, a large multimodal multilingual dataset.

https://lnkd.in/gUaA5kNZ

WIT is the largest publicly available multimodal dataset based on image-text examples.

WIT includes 108 languages.

WIT has lots of contextual information in addition to the image-text examples.

WIT is replete with real-world knowledge and entities.

WIT Dataset is available for download use under a Creative Commons license.

You can read more details about WIT in our paper accepted at SIGIR 2021. There is also a short presentation with slides.

WIT has been used in another one of our recent work MURAL: MUltilingual MUltitask Retrieval Across Languages, to appear in the Findings of EMNLP 2021.

We are very happy to announce an image-text competition based on the WIT dataset. We are collaborating with Wikimedia Research and a few other external collaborators and hosting this on Kaggle.

We just published a new capstone project in the Data Engineering Academy using Fast API, Kafka, Spark Streaming, MongoDB and Streamlit. Plus Docker. ðŸš€
Here are the details:

2 hours 45 minutes of videos for the new course called Document Streaming ðŸš€

This is a full end to end capstone project. The project uses e-commerce data that contains invoices for customers and items on these invoices.

Our goal is to ingest the invoice data, as it is getting generated, and visualize it in a user interface.

The technologies we use are FastAPI, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, MongoDB and Streamlit. Tools you already learned in the academy individually. I recommend you take a look into these courses first.
We also use Docker as the main environment.

We also included many links after the videos where you can do even more in depth research.

Here is an overview of the curriculum:
âœ… Project Introduction
âœ… Preparing the data
âœ… Data API
âœ… Apache Kafka & API as Docker
âœ… Apache Spark structured streaming into Kafka
âœ… MongoDB
âœ… Spark Streaming into MongoDB
âœ… The API client writing JSONs
âœ… Streamlit Dashboard
âœ… Conclusion
