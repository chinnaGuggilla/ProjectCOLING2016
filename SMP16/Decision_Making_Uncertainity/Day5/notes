Day 5 - Forecasting

trend - consistent increase and consistet decrease for aparticular period of time

step1 - draw the time series
		Demand Vs time
step2 - Identify the pattern
		Trend :
				Forma t axis -  6, 12, 18, spikes
				
		seasonality - regular patterns
				Demand is seasonal - 4, 8, 12 - down spikes
				Intervals are regular
		Random pattern - horizontal pattern: 
				Constant unknown average demand with unknwon factors
		Horizontal pattern with level shift
				Sudden change in average due to added inputs
		Cyclical pattern
				- length of the intervals are not fixed
				- 

Forecasting methods:
		Qualitative methods
		When launching brand new category of product - no history available
		Ex: Apple smart watch
		Quantitative methods
		historical data , patterns in the past likely to holds good in future
		
		Forecasting won't be accurate
		
Accuracy of forecasts:
		
One-step forecast: Use 1 month data and make forecast for 2nd month, then use 1st and 2nd month data and make forecast for 3rd month.
Compare accuracy of different forecasting methods:   
	MAD: Mean absolute Deviation
	MSE: Mean squared error
	MAPE: Mean absolute percentage error: can be used to compare forecasts for different categories
	Forecasts -  5kg packets, sachets , the impact of errors will be different on packets than the sachets
	depends on base - base can be changed from last year to current year, the impact of error will be different
	Bases are different then use MAPE compared to MAD or MSE
	Across SKUS, across products and across categories
	
	MAD vs MSE
	Binary decision Vs reward based decisions
	MSE have similar errors - punishes errors
	MSE in FMCG, inventory
	Huge deviations are bad for you.
	correct or incorrect then MAD make sense irrespective of deviations or fwar away of two errors

Exercise 2: Salt data	
Horizontal pattern - No consistent pattern, there is unknown average
		     Salt demand does not chnage drastically
		     Overfit - error metrics can be 0 but foreacst may not correct
		     Randomness will be there
	what forecasting method we use? how to get the forecast for week 13.
	One-step forecast,  average is unknown
	(Naive forecast method) - Not very impressive method
	Disadvantage: Error increases week by week. Kagging by one week
	Average method: compute average between previous and current value
	Avg method is better than Naive method, values are greater than naive method
		Coming  closer and closer to horizontal line

Horizontal pattern with level shift:	
	sudden change in particular period of time - level change
	could be due to randomness or systematic pattern	
	moving average method :
		It would take some time to keep with level change values - longer it would take to pick up the average
		last k- recent values
	exponential smoothing:
		level - k: average of 1/3rd or 1/2 of data
		adjusting level: previous level + alpha (smoothing parameter , 0.5, 0<alpha<1) * error
