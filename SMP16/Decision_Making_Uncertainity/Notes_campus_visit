Sampling																	
Simple random selection			equal chance														
convinient sampling - bias			deal with systematic bias				min samples - 30		Central limit theorem								
Point estimate  - use sample mean to estimate the unknown population mean																	
confidence interval -    when confidence is low in deciding single value go for a range									0 to infinity								
																	
0% of confidence interval			in average														
																	
95% confidence interval			commonly used % in confidence intervals														
90%																	
99%																	
																	
In case of profit  - mean make sense																	
mean make sense if you are looking at medium level income/variable																	
																	
How to get confidence itnervals?																	
																	
     	x'+/-  Z * sigma/sqrt(N)				larger the confidence wider the interval												
																	
	1.96    -  95%																
	1.645   - 90																
	2.576 - 99%																
																	
	x1 - sample poulation																
																	
controlling for variables -  within the same group, people react to different things																	
																	
Regression analysis			predict some value														
			predictor variables							y=a+b*online							
Simple linear regression   - linear function of these variables						Dependent variable											
						Independent variable											
Beta = 0  weights are zero																	
																	
Hypothesis testing			null hypothesis		Ho	b	0					reject hypothesis		do not reject the hypothesis			
			Alternate Hypothesis		H1/Ha	b	not 0										
									consturct confidence level						h0 true	h0 false	
			level of significance		error of tolerance		alpha							reject	error		type-I error
														not reject 		error	type-II error



profit = intercept + b1*online + b1*age

decide sample size based on the width of the confidence interval


How would we chose optimal interval width with higher confidence ? is 95% confidence interval is optimal and standard one?


Day 3:  05/04/2020

Significance F value >0 indicates that
     Independent variables are not useful
      non linear relationships

Drop the variable if p-value >0.5 and rerun the regression. coefficient values changes

R^2 = 1 highest coefficient determination

With other variables R^2 value would get to 98%
