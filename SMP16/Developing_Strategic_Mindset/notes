strategic mindset and analogical reasoning

Information rich settings



		
			deduction											Analogical reasoning						trail and error
			scientific laws and applying them to data at hand	partial novel settings						don't have broad principles anddata 	 										resembling earlier settings				    and data is limited
			
																most strategic decisions
																happens here (cognitive sci)
																leaders with analogical reasoning ahead of others 
																
																Disruptive innovation
																
																innovators dilemma
																low cost and low premium, incumbment players
																
																
																										highly ambigous settings
																shifting the cost curve
																dispropotionately lower price not proportionally low
																
																Story1: [integrated mills, minimills story]
																
																Story2: British motor cycle (hand crafted, high quality)
																
																		competitiors: yamaha, etc
																		
																			quality not as british motor cycle
																			low quality but prices are disproportionatley lower
																			
																pattern across these 2 stories and challenge at Intel
																premium pentium processors, got into low-end configuration to compete in the lower end
																
																uncertianty conditions
																analogical reasoning - best judgement - startegic decisions
																
		The process of analogical reasoning - comes with breadth of experience
		start seeing wide varities of patterns
		
		Saliency bias - for a given problem - multiple analogies (bias that recently exposed to)
						similarties are known and differences are ignored, pay attention to differences 
						
		The key ingridients of startegic thinking:
		
		
		The three fundamental questions for the strategist
		
			
	Bharath forge ltd:
	
		Baba Kalyani up against:	1980: low quality, inconsitency, low price
									global presence/vision (Baba has global vision but India was not ready for global presence (restrictive permission)
									skill/employee tranformation
									Indian economy in 1980 is not favorable
									B2B context
									Business synargies
									
		challenges:  late comer disadvantage ( positional disavantage)
					 legitamacy and capability disadvantage ( locational disavtnage)
					 
					 CDP: postional disvantage only
					 BFL :  both disdvantages
					 
		setting up a larger capacity:? which strategic direction you would follow? smaller capacity or larger capacity?
		
		capacity plays a larger role in the volatile and dynamic market
		arbitrage of capacity utilization
		modernized capacity available to OEM (JIT), cost is very low to keep capacity idel in India in 1980 comapred to detroit 
		high quality capacity is useful
		
		Totally new workforce
					only graduates  -  cost (gratuity, insurance) and Generalized-cross functional team-JIT delivery, Agile, specialized etc
					pay higher salaries
					separate culture
		
		Pricing strategy:
							Regular price (capture domestic and JIT orders from overseas)
							Premium price
		
		Demerged the company?    During recession time (1996-1997)
								 Non-manufacturing assets lying on the books
								structural industry changes - cyclic demand and supply
								helps in qcqiusitions  - focus businesses, serious player
								focused balance sheet - better valuation, dilutions is lower, incase of equity over acquisitions
								
		Developing a global presence:
							Building the design facility
							stickyness of relationships - capacity to gain market share
		
		Passenger car forgings:
								Potential for differentiation - visibility/attention in customer segments
								
		Acuired quirkstall:
							would you do it?
							order book - exploit sticky and old suppliers from Europe OEM suppliers
		Acquired CDP:   Would have done it?
						
					     banks -> employees ->management -> customers
						 
						 Thyssuncrup :  similar capability profile to CDP
						 
									BFL anf CDP are having different capabilities
						 			Guarantees the employment for CDP employees
						Acuqired CDP at 6m though the total purchase price is 29 m. thats because majority pie came from German banks
		CDP and alumni forgings:  lightweight cars/vehicles, chinese market and global automotives
		
		capacity as a resource : as and when needed, cost and quality at benchmark level
		
					newer capability acusitions: quirkstall, CDP
									serving volatile demand, augmenting new capabilities
